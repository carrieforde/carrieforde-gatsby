Before becoming a software engineer, I worked as a business analyst liaising between sales and technical teams to translate business needs into technical requirements. These days, I work directly with my business stakeholders to define a technical roadmap, and make their requirements a reality.

I currently work at [Freedom Financial Network](https://www.freedomfinancialnetwork.com) where I design and implement clever frontend solutions for [Lendage](https://lendage.com).

I reach for these technologies on a daily basis:

  <li>Firebase</li>
  <li>Webpack</li>

</ul>
